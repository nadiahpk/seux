Description: Infers the extinction of undiscovered species using the SEUX model. The model
    takes as an input the years of first and last detections of species within a taxonomic group
    (e.g. from herbarium data), and assumes that the probability of extinction in discovered
    species is the same as that in undiscovered species. See Chisholm et al. (2016) for details.
